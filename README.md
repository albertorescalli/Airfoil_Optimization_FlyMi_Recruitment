# Airfoil Optimization - FlyMi Recruitment


## Description

This project is an airfoil optimization tool developed specifically for the FlyMi recruitment process. The program leverages XFoil to simulate different airfoil configurations, optimizing key aerodynamic parameters like lift coefficient (CL), drag coefficient (CD), and the lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) at various angles of attack. The tool automates simulations and performs a Pareto front analysis to identify the optimal configuration for cruise efficiency and maximum CL.


## Installation

1. Requirements
No external libraries or programs are required.

2. Compile prompt
To compile the program, use the following command:

g++ -o airfoil_optimization Source\main.cpp Source\format_airfoil.cpp Source\config_settings.cpp Source\control_xfoil.cpp Source\load_airfoil.cpp Source\simulate_airfoil.cpp Source\store_sim_results.cpp Source\build_pareto_front.cpp Source\find_optimal_config.cpp Source\generate_output.cpp


## Usage

1. Input
The program takes as input an airfoil coordinates file (in .dat format) placed in the 'Input' folder (in which there are some demo files downloaded from the UIUC Airfoil Data Site, available at https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html). It reads the coordinates and sets up the airfoil geometry.

2. Execution
During execution, the user is prompted to specify simulation parameters, including chord, cruise speed and kinematic viscosity. The program then runs the XFoil simulations based on the provided parameters, stores the data generated by XFoil and finally find the optimal configuration by creating a Pareto front, trying to maximize both CL and L/D at the same time.

3. Output
The results of the simulations are stored in the 'Output' folder as 'sim_results.dat' and 'optimization_recap.txt'.

## Program Workflow

1. Airfoil Loading
The program begins by reading the airfoil coordinates from the input file located in the 'Input' folder. The airfoil is formatted following XFoil requirements and validated for simulation.

2. Configuration Setup
The values of simulation parameters can be found and manually changed in the file 'config_settings.cpp', located inside the 'Source' folder.
Initally, they are set to the following default values:

    -Panel nodes: 160           (It is the default XFoil value)
    -Iteration limit: 100       (It has been increased from the XFoil default value of 10 to prevent too many convergence failures)
    -Starting AOA: 0.0        
    -Ending AOA: 10.0
    -AOA Increment: +0.5        

Additionally, during program execution, the user can specify various parameters such as the vehicle's chord, the cruise speed, and the fluid's kinematic viscosity. Initially, they are set to the following default values:

    -Chord: 0.2334 m                    (Nyx's chord has been used to set a realistic value as a starting point)
    -Cruise speed: 15.5 m/s ≈ 30 kts    (It has been set 25% lower than IMECHE's KTAS limit for the 2025 fly-off Event)
    -Kinematic viscosity: 1.5e-5 m^2/s  (Air's kinematic viscosity @ 1 atm, 20°C)

These settings are first used to calculate the Reynolds number, then configured in the program and passed to XFoil.

3. XFoil Simulations
The program interacts with XFoil to run simulations for the specified range of angles of attack. For each angle, the program reads CL, CD, and L/D.

4. Storing Results
Raw simulation results are stored in sim_results.dat, which is overwritten every time a new simulation is performed.

5. Pareto Front Analysis
The program performs a Pareto front analysis using airfoil simulation data to identify trade-offs between different aerodynamic parameters, helping to determine the optimal airfoil performance at a specified cruise speed. The Pareto front represents the set of points where no other point offers both a higher lift coefficient (cL) and better efficiency (cL/cD).

The 'buildParetoFront' function processes the lift (cL), drag (cD), and angle of attack (alpha) values obtained from XFoil simulations. It compares each point to others in the dataset to determine whether it is Pareto optimal, meaning no subsequent point provides a better trade-off between lift and efficiency.

Points with invalid lift or drag values (i.e., zero) are ignored, and if a point is dominated by another in both lift and efficiency, it is excluded from the Pareto front. The resulting Pareto front is stored in a global vector of pairs (cL, efficiency).

Subsequently, the 'findOptimalConfig' function identifies the optimal configuration for an airfoil based on the Pareto front calculated from the simulation results. It selects the first point from the Pareto front as the optimal solution, as this point is the first dominant value, meaning it is the initial point in the dataset against which all subsequent points have lower values in at least one of the parameters: lift coefficient (cL) or efficiency. The function then retrieves the corresponding angle of attack (alpha) along with its lift, drag, and efficiency values that maximize the trade-off between these parameters. Finally, the results are displayed to the user.

If no points are found in the Pareto front or if the matching values cannot be located in the simulation data, an error message is printed, and the program exits.

6. Output Generation
The optimization's results are summarized and written to the file 'optimization_recap.txt', located in the 'Output' folder.
*NOTE*: It is important to move this file to a safe location, as further simulation will otherwise overwrite its content.


## Improvements and Additional Features

1. Error Handling
Currently, the program handles compromising errors by printing an error message and terminating program execution. An improvement would be to implement more sophisticated error handling mechanisms that allow the user to correct them and retry simulations without restarting the entire program. For example, if convergence fails for every alpha, the program could prompt the user to reset the simulation parameters.

2. Graphical Output
Although the current implementation focuses on maximizing portability and performance, an additional feature could involve generating graphs for key parameters, such as:

    CL vs. Alpha
    CD vs. Alpha
    L/D vs. Alpha
    CL vs. CD
    Pareto Curve

At present, this feature has not been implemented to avoid requiring additional libraries like Python (matplotlib) or Boost, ensuring that the program remains lightweight and easily portable across different systems.

3. Parametric Simulations for Chord Length
Another useful feature would be the ability to automatically run simulations for a range of chord lengths around the user-specified value. This would provide more comprehensive data on how chord length affects the airfoil’s aerodynamic performance, giving users additional insights into optimal configurations.
